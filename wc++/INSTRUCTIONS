Create a program that computes some statistics about a text file stored on disk.
Please include instructions for using it.

The statistics are:

	whitespace-delimited word count,
	line count,
	average number of letters per word (to one decimal place) and
	most common letter.

We will check the accuracy of the output;  assess the program for style and
readability;  and also look at how easy it is to extend your program to compute
additional statistics.  The expectation is that you produce production-level
code with all associated measures --- testing, documentation etc..
